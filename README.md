# TF Web app 

** An image classification web app using TF(inference), React(frontend) and Flask(backend) based on this [([Medium article]](https://medium.com/sopra-steria-norge/build-a-simple-image-classification-app-using-react-keras-and-flask-7b9075e3b6f5)). Decided to try this since they had a working web app running on Heroku, which is what my end goal was.**



However, couldn't get this to work even locally. Weirdly, it did only after adding a GET request check - if anyone can explain that to me, would be nice :sweat:



Still need to learn how react and flask communicate, I think there is something wrong with the urls/requests, but no clue how to debug...
